show me how fast your favorite language is

* data.log has 1mio lines.  
  * for example
  * `1402167211.219568	7935 ziproxy@1.2.3.4 S 76297  76297   GET http://lO8FzwGnE%?6Q?kOJtJ3"oURnQgzww7pA&yMQ7LU9L)ZEx"QrC80VyWfvsOW`
* separator is 1-5 spaces
* sum column 5, divide the result with 1000 and display it as "Original size $var kb.\n"
* sum column 6, divide the result with 1000 and display it as "Compressed size $var kb.\n"

I'll run every committed script on the same digital ocean 512MB VPS to have compareable values.  
So please note, there is probably not enough memory to load the file complete into the memory.

* `data.log.tar.xz` is the big file
* `testdata.log` is a small 100 lines long file for development

#### most wanted
* python
* ruby
* java 
* c
